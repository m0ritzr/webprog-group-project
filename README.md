Group Project for Web Programming 2023

- React app

## Local Dev
- Clone the repo
- first time (run `npm install`)
- run `vercel dev` to deploy locally

## Branching
- When working on a feature/change, create a branch with `name/feature`
- Commit changes to the branch
- When creating a PR, vercel will automatically try to deploy the app and it'll be accessible via URL
- Once deploy is done and if there are no merge conflicts, ask someone else to review your PR
- If there are no comments or fixes to be done, merge branch to main
